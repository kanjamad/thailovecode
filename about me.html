        <p>
            Hello! I'm <strong>Kanjamad</strong><i> but you can call me</i> <strong> Por</strong> 
            Coding has changed my world!   Learning how to code has taught me another way of communicating  with other people in our age of technology.  Developing websites is one skill I've learned which promises to lead me to in finding a stable job in the future. I've gained all my knowledge about this platform at <strong><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming" target="_blank"> khanacademy</a></strong>,  <strong><a href="http://www.sololearn.com" target="_blank"> SoloLearn </a></strong> , <strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank"> W3school </a></strong>, 
            <strong><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank"> codecademy </a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank"> FreeCodeCamp </a></strong>. I've been able to  create a simple game which has built my self-esteem and kept me motivated. I joined a Web Development meetup to foster relationships in the industry and network with individuals who share the same passion. 
 
                 I am from Thailand  where I earned a science degree which led to a position at National Cancer Institute in Thailand. I came to USA in 2014 with a student exchange visa. I lived with my host family in heart of Silicon Valley, California. My host family graduated from MIT and are employed in the tech industry which allows them, and large groups of employees to work from home  which is very appealing to me! 
             
                  Within Silicon Valley are many companies, Google (self driving cars ), Facebook, Apple, YouTube, NASA, which are leading the way in technology advances.  Living here has sparked my interest in programming. I started teaching myself how to code by reading books, accessing free website, and joining free classes. Challenges, such as pronunciation, have surfaced due to English not being my first language. Technology has lessened this challenge as I see myself making cool animations and games, writing blogs and much more
                
                 I look forward to remaining in the US with my husband and pursing a career in technology. This post was originally written Sep 3rd, 2018. I decide to develop my  skills more at UC Berkeley Extension coding. My class started on September 10, 2018.
